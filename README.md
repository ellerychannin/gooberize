# gooberize

‘Gooberize’ is an emotionally intelligent chrome extension that helps users on Youtube not take the Internet too seriously, specifically through detecting the toxic comments and re-rendering them into a funny rhymed version to defuse the tension and anger that might upset anyone browsing the comment section.

I believe ‘Gooberize’ could bring a delightful browsing experience for any user who gets frustrated by stumbling across toxic comments on Youtube. With over 2.6 billion monthly active users, Youtube inevitably faces a big challenge of moderating the toxicity on its own platform. There has been various approaches to address the issue ranging from removing public displays of dislikes to introducing a 24-hour timeout when user detected in posting abusive comments. Most of the attempts issued by Youtube have been top-down regulations that decide whether to remove the content once for all. However, there is little control or creativity over how users themselves can approach the toxicity on the platform. ‘Gooberize’ is a different bottom-up approach that listens to our individual emotional needs and up-cycles various levels of online toxicity into goofiness and laughters.
